> [!info] Doom Nukem
> Doom Nukem pushes the possibilities of Raycasting much further while bringing a dimension of Game design, so you are going to have to make a mix of Doom and Duke Nukem 3D. It's up to you to find the one that suits you and that will allow you to add the requested features as well as those you want to see there.
